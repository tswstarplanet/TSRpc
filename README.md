# TSRpc Project
This is a framework that helps developers build RPC servers and clients. It achieves perfect integration with Spring Boot. Through an extensible architecture, it implements service registration, discovery, and remote invocation. Currently, the available registry is Nacos, and the supported service protocol is HTTP. By simply adding dependencies and some straightforward configurations and annotations, you can quickly build server and client applications.
